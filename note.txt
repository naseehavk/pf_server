SOFWARE PATTERN / ARCHITECHTURE 
------------------------------

1.MVC - Model view Controllor

MODEL - A component that helps to inetract with db 
VIEW  - component where user interacts 
CONTROLLER - Component which handles the working logic of server 

// ----Routing - maps comming result and 
redirect the coming request with matching path to controller 

controller executes data 

ConTROLLER interacts with model , what data needs to taken from database

MODEL fetches data from database and passes to Controller 

CONTROLLER sends the data as response to VIEW 

VIEW data renders and user gets the data----//


2.MVT - model view Template
Model - Component that interacts with db
View - component that handles work logic and also make sure how response is rendered in template 
Template - user interface
etc

=> request = Header + body 

MongoDB==>
===========

-what is MongoDB
------------------
MongoDB is a no-sql non-relational schemaless json-document based dbms


-what are the features
-------------------------
-No sql 
-non-relational
-no specific schemaless
-open-source
-Data collected as JSON documents
-flexible

-----RDMS ------  -----MongoDB-----------
Database            Database
Table               Collections
Tuple/row           Dcoument 
Column              Fields
Primary Key         _id[12 character hexadecimel value ]

=>ADvantages 
---------------
-schemaless,flexible,No sql etc
-faster
-Scalable //bigdata technology

install Mongodb and mongodb compass


------------
MONGOOSE ----
------------
=>its a MongoDB object modelling tool
=> for intialising object and model for mongodbs and connect them 


model equal to collections
acts like a class 

FORM DATA CLASS
----------------
if you neeed to share file and texts
const formdata()=new formdata

by default : application/json 
    here : multipart/form-data


MULTER :
--------------
-3rd party middleware package for file handling
-configure
-install
